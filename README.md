**Project: Canteen Ordering System for  Unilever**


**Description:**

Unilever is a British-Dutch MNC FMCG company, headquartered in London,  England. Unilever is one of the oldest FMCG companies, and its products are  available in around 190 countries. In its UK offices, Unilever had around 1500 employees which were spread across 12 floors. They had 2 canteens to cater 
to these 1500 employees. Each canteen could seat around 150 employees at 
a time. 
Most employees would prefer to take their lunch between 12 noon to 1 pm. 
This led to a huge rush in the canteen during lunch hours resulting in 
employees wasting a lot of time waiting for tables to be vacant.
Management calculated that it took around 60 minutes for employees to go 
and come back from lunch. Almost 30-35 minutes were wasted waiting in a 
queue to collect their food and get a table to sit and eat. However, the time 
spent eating was barely 10-15 minutes. The remaining 10 minutes were 
spent reaching and coming back from the canteen using the elevators. 


Employees don’t always get their choice of food they want because the canteen runs out 
of certain items. The canteen wastes a significant quantity of food by throwing away 
what is not purchased.
Many employees have requested a system that would permit a canteen user to order 
meals online, to be delivered to their work location at a specified time and date.
Advantages of the Canteen Ordering System:
• A system would save considerable time for those employees who use the service.
• It would increase the chance of them getting the food items they prefer.
• This would improve both their quality of work-life and their productivity.
• The food wastage will be reduced.
• This will reduce the cost.
The client invited Business Analysts to capture the requirements to 
create the Canteen Ordering System.

**Problem Statement and Motivation**

• The employee shall open the web page of the Canteen Ordering 
System. He/she shall be presented with an up-to-date menu for 
the day. It will have a list of all the dishes available in the canteen 
for the day along with its prices.

• The lunch order can be placed by employees latest by 11 am. After 
11 am the system shall not allow the users to place orders for 
lunch items so that the chefs have sufficient time to cook the 
ordered dishes. There should be a Menu Manager (a canteen 
employee) who shall create the menu and update the menu.

• The users can select the lunch dishes they would like to eat and 
create an order. They should be able to edit the items they want to 
order any time before checking out.

• Once the order is confirmed and the user has checked out, they 
should NOT be able to cancel or edit the order.

• The canteen manager also known as an order processor should be 
able to view the orders placed by the employees. He shall take an 
inventory of all the dishes ordered by different users and get them 
cooked by the chef.

• This canteen manager should be able to request a delivery to the 
employees’ workstation.

• There shall be a meal deliverer (delivery boy) who shall deliver the 
lunch to the employee's desk. After delivering the lunch, this delivery 
boy shall close the online customer order.

• If a customer does not like any food item or is not happy with the 
delivery system by the canteen, they should be able to submit 
feedback.

• There is no payment gateway for the same so the payment for dishes 
ordered shall be deducted from the employee’s salary. Hence, the 
employees need to enroll for salary payment deduction. The payroll 
system will handle payroll deductions.

• At the end of the month the payroll system shall calculate the total 
number of dishes ordered by each employee. The payroll system shall 
deduct money from the employee’s salary.


**Management would like the following reports:**

• Which dishes are the most popular?

• How many employees are using the system?

• Satisfaction of the employees on using the system. This should be 
tracked on the basis of feedback submitted by the employees.

• Sales for each day

• Total monthly earnings

• Order forecasting i.e. a prediction of which items will be ordered and 
when they will be ordered.
